# Web Dev Course for Leonardo Russo
## About
This is a tailored course for [Leonardo Russo](https://github.com/LeonardoRusso1).

I am helping Leonardo to start a *web developer* career.

We are currently exploring vanilla JavaScript.

## Structure
During my lessons I use some example code to show the different JavaScript features.

There is a subfolder called `exercises` where I publish all the challenges.
