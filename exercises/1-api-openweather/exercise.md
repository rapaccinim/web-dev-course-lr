# Exercise - API - OpenWeather
* do a `git fetch` to check if there are differences (between the origin and your local code)
* if there are differences, do a `git pull` before proceding 
* create a free account on [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* remember that you could have to wait some minutes/hours before the API key activation
* create a file index.html with a basic HTML structure with two input textboxes (1 for city name, 1 for the API key) and a button for submit
* write a simple JS code that 1) takes the two input values from the html form when the user submits data, 2) use the data to make an HTTP call to the OpenWeather API
* check in the Network tab of the browser's inspection tool that the Response from the API is a valid JSON object, then copy-paste the JSON object into a file .json
* commit and push your code (all the js files, the index.html and the file.json), being careful about the API key's security
* all the files of this exercise have to be under the `/wed-dev-course-lr/exercises/1-api-openweather/` folder
