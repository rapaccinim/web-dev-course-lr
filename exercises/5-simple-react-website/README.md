# Simple React Website
* create a React SPA that is the exact copy of the previous exercise number 4
* when hovering the menu hamburger icon in the top right, a component called `Menu` has to appear from the right, covering all the screen with a white background that has a smooth opacity
* the `Menu` component has:
	* 3 items (`Home`, `About`, `Contact`). When hovering on a menu item, it changes color (you choose what color) and an underline effect appears
	* a close icon in the top right that closes the menu
* render the content of the main page (the one with the pictures) only after 5 seconds, in the meantime show a spinning wheel (you can downlaod a GIF from the web and use it in the public assets folder)
* design your personal logo and place it in the top left where there's `HereGoesLogo` and try to add the effect that resizes (smaller) the logo and the header when the user scroll downs the page (suggestion: search for the following keywords `shrink header scroll`)
